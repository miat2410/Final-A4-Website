            To stay immobilised and silent whilst our natural world is under siege is a crime against nature. It seems that humans have lost their connection to the environment and the planet. If we’re to change the demise, we have to be courageous to face ourselves, get real about what is happening and act from a place of deep compassion. It is no longer acceptable to “turn a blind eye”…we are all in this together and it’s our job to make a change, however small. Australia has a terrible record of animal cruelty and the demise of wildlife, and in comparison with the rest of the world we are failing on so many fronts and currently claim the highest rate of extinction in mammals on the planet It is the aim of this organisation to raise Australia’s presence to not only step up, but lead the world when it comes to the preservation and protection of wilderness and wildlife.

            For the Love of Wildlife believes education, reporting, collaborating with like minded organisations and holding those responsible for crimes against nature, is essential to change our world. We are focused and dedicated in raising awareness along with funding animal protection programs in ethical projects in Australia, New Zealand and Africa.Humans have a responsibility to protect animals from exploitation, suffering or potential suffering whether due to acts imposed by humans or acts of nature, by advocating and/or intervening on their behalf and by enhancing their rights and well being wherever possible through compassionate action and ethical stewardship.
