            The organisation has achieved much success with ongoing programs, projects and awareness acts including having a ban on the importation of lion trophies (body parts) in 2015 which was a massive turning point in the lives of the lions. They also triggered a parliamentary joint committee inquiry into domestic trade in Australia, ultimately leading to domestic trade closing as well as on World Wild Life Day (March 2018), hosted Australia first ivory and rhino horn crush in Melbourne, demonstrating the ongoing poaching crisis of animals. ‘For the Love of Wildlife’ also partnered with ‘Nature Needs More’, bringing to light the massive legal trade in wild/endangered species, addressing the issue of trying to identify many species at once and the compromise this has on those that are endangered. Therefore, through modernising Convention on international Trade in Endangered Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), 36,000 species were positively impacted, as well as having an overall impact on the illicit trade. The company states: “We are effective because we are small, nimble and results driven”.
